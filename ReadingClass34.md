# How are releases and versioning related?
In software development, versioning assigns unique identifiers (like numbers) to different stages of a program. Releases are specific versions of the software made available to users. The version number indicates the nature of changes, like major updates or bug fixes. Versioning helps track changes, and releases are instances of the software at specific points. Users can decide to update based on the significance of changes and their impact.
# What are the 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?
Configure Your App for Release:

Disable and remove logging.
Set debuggable to false in Groovy or isDebuggable to false in Kotlin script.
Define your app's version information.
Build and Sign a Release Version of Your App:

Use the Gradle build files with the release build type to build and sign a release version of your app.
Test the Release Version:

Thoroughly test the release version on at least one target handset device and one target tablet device. Consider using Firebase Test Lab for testing across various devices and configurations.
Update App Resources for Release:

Ensure all app resources, including multimedia files and graphics, are updated and included with your app or staged on the proper production servers.
Prepare Remote Servers and Services:

If your app depends on external servers or services, make sure they are secure and production-ready.
