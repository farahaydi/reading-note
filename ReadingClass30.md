# Tutorial: Hash Tables Implementation

## What is a Hash Table?
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index where an element will be inserted or searched.

### Step 1: Why Use a Hash Table?

WHY: In a large library, finding books by their titles quickly is crucial. Using a hash table helps us achieve this efficiently.
### Step 2: What is a Hash Function?

WHAT: A hash function is like a magic formula that takes an input (in our case, a book title) and turns it into a unique identifier (a number).
WHY: This ensures fast access to data. In our case, book titles will be keys, and the hash function will determine where each book is stored.
### Step 3: Setting Up the Hash Table

WHAT: Create a hash table as an array where each element is a slot.
WHY: This is where the books will be stored based on their titles' hash values.
HOW: Imagine it as a series of labeled shelves, each capable of holding multiple books.
### Step 4: Inserting Books

WHAT: We'll insert books into the hash table.
WHY: This step allows us to organize the books based on their titles.
HOW: Think of placing books on the respective shelves based on the output of our hash function.
### Step 5: Finding a Book

WHAT: We'll find a book using its title.
WHY: This demonstrates the efficiency of hash tables in locating items.
HOW: We apply the same hash function to find out which shelf the book is on, and then look for it among the books on that shelf.
### Step 6: Using the Hash Table

WHAT: Perform insertions and searches.
WHY: This is where we put our hash table into action.
HOW: Imagine handling the books, placing them on the shelves, and then retrieving them when needed.

## Create a vocabulary/definition list
Hashing:

Definition: Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify objects by converting them into a smaller, fixed-size value (hash code) using a hash function.
Hash Function:

Definition: A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or "key") and transforms it into a unique, fixed-size value (hash code).
Hash Table:

Definition: A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where the keys are hashed using a hash function to determine their storage location.
Key:

Definition: In a hash table, a key is a unique identifier used to access and retrieve associated values.
Value:

Definition: In a hash table, a value is the data associated with a specific key.
Collision:

Definition: A collision occurs in a hash table when two or more different keys produce the same hash code. Handling collisions is an important aspect of hash table implementation.
Load Factor:

Definition: The load factor of a hash table is the ratio of the number of stored items (entries) to the total number of slots available. It affects the performance of the hash table.
Separate Chaining:

Definition: Separate chaining is a collision resolution technique where each slot in the hash table contains a linked list. Colliding keys are stored in the same linked list.
Open Addressing:

Definition: Open addressing is a collision resolution technique where all entry records are stored within the hash table itself. When a collision occurs, a different slot is sought.
Linear Probing:

Definition: Linear probing is a specific form of open addressing where the interval between successive probes is fixed (usually to 1).
Quadratic Probing:

Definition: Quadratic probing is a variation of open addressing where the interval between successive probes is computed by adding successive values of an arbitrary polynomial.
Double Hashing:

Definition: Double hashing is another open addressing technique where the interval between probes is computed using two different hash functions.
Associative Array:

Definition: An associative array is an abstract data type that stores key-value pairs, allowing rapid access to the value associated with a given key.
Hash Collision Resolution:

Definition: It refers to the process of dealing with situations where two different keys produce the same hash code, ensuring that both keys can be stored and retrieved correctly.
Average Case Time Complexity:

Definition: It is the expected time taken to perform an operation (such as search or insert) in a data structure, considering all possible inputs and their probabilities.
Prime Number:

Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
