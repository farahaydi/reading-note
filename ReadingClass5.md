# Teaching Linked Lists
> **WHAT**: Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to store a collection of elements, where each element is stored as a node containing data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

> **WHY**: Linked lists are used because they offer dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion and deletion, and can handle varying sizes of data.

> **HOW** : Let's dive into how linked lists work using a simple analogy and a step-by-step example.

>> **Analogy**: Think of linked lists like a train. Each train car represents a node, and each car is linked to the next car in the sequence.

What is a linked list?
Why are linked lists useful?
What does each node in a linked list contain?
How is traversal achieved in a linked list?
How can you insert a new node into a linked list?

> **Vocabulary/Definition List:**

Linked List: A data structure where elements (nodes) are connected through references.
Node: An element in a linked list containing data and a reference to the next node.
Head: The first node in a linked list.
Tail: The last node in a linked list.
Insertion: Adding a new node to a linked list.
Deletion: Removing a node from a linked list.
Traversal: Moving through the linked list by following references.


> **Cheat Sheet:**

Linked List: Collection of nodes with data and links.
Singly Linked List: Each node has a link to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node has links to both the next and previous nodes.
Circular Linked List: Last node links back to the first node.

> Traversal: The process of moving through a linked list by following the references from one node to another.
> Insertion: Adding a new node to a linked list, which involves updating references in neighboring nodes.
> Deletion: Removing a node from a linked list, which involves adjusting references to bypass the deleted node.
