# What does it mean to authenticate a user?
 To authenticate a user means to verify their identity. In the context of web applications and systems, it involves confirming that the user is who they claim to be. This process typically involves the following steps:

 User provides credentials: The user provides some form of identification, usually a username or email, along with a corresponding password or other authentication tokens.

 Verification of credentials: The system checks the provided credentials against its stored records. If they match, it indicates that the user is authentic.

 Granting access: Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to the system or application.

# What does it mean to authorize a user?

 Authorization is the process of granting specific permissions or access rights to a user after they have been authenticated. It involves defining access control policies, often using roles and permissions, to determine what actions or resources a user can interact with. Authorization can be very detailed, allowing for fine-grained control over access, and it's an ongoing process that requires monitoring to ensure users only have appropriate access based on their roles and responsibilities. This is crucial for information security as it prevents unauthorized activities and protects sensitive data.

# What are the three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManagerâ€™s authenticate() method?
The three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManager's authenticate() method are:

Return an Authentication object (usually with authenticated=true): This happens when the AuthenticationManager is able to verify that the provided credentials represent a valid user or principal.

Throw an AuthenticationException: If the AuthenticationManager determines that the provided credentials are invalid or cannot be authenticated, it will throw an AuthenticationException. This indicates that the authentication process failed.

Return null: In some cases, the AuthenticationManager might not be able to make a determination, and it will return null. This typically means that it cannot decide based on the provided information.
