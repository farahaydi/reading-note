**What does “strong typed” mean? In Java, there are eight primitive data types known as "Primitive Data Types.**" 
>These data types are used to represent simple values and are not objects.int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean and char
-------------
**What are the primitive data types?**
>This means that each variable in Java must have a declared data type, and once a variable is assigned a specific data type, it cannot be used as if it were of another type without explicit type conversion.

**Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.**

>Java: You follow a detailed instruction booklet (Java code), then a master builder (compiler) translates it into precise steps (bytecode) for a LEGO robot (computer) to build the model. The robot follows the steps accurately, creating the LEGO model (working program).

>JavaScript: With a magical wand (JavaScript code), you instantly bring the LEGO model to life. As you wave the wand, the LEGO pieces assemble themselves. If there's a mistake, the magic pauses, but if all spells are right, the model forms (program execution is finished).

**Does code complining mean that it works correctly?No, code compilation does not guarantee that the code will work correctly.**
>Compilation is the process of translating human-readable code into machine-readable instructions, but it doesn't check for logical errors or bugs in the code

**How many keywords does Java have?**
