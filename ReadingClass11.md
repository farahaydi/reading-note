# What role do the @Controller classes play in a Spring MVC application?

    In a Spring MVC application, @Controller classes play a pivotal role. They are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, executing business logic, and preparing responses for clients. Key responsibilities include:

Request Handling: Controllers manage HTTP requests, routing them to specific methods within the class based on URL mappings.

Business Logic: Controllers contain the application's business logic, allowing them to perform actions like data retrieval, processing, and service invocations.

Model Population: Data is populated into a model object or ModelAndView, which is passed to the view layer for rendering.

View Resolution: Controllers select an appropriate view, such as a JSP or Thymeleaf template, to render the response and present data to the user.

URL Mapping: Controllers are associated with specific URL patterns through annotations like @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, or @PostMapping

# Explain to a non-technical friend what a GET request is.
Imagine you're browsing the internet, and you want to see a specific web page, like a news article or a picture of a cute puppy. When you click on a link or type a web address into your browser's address bar and hit "Enter," your browser sends a request to the web server where that web page is stored.

This request is called a "GET request." It's like asking the server, "Can you please give me the web page at this address?" The server then responds by sending back the requested web page, which your browser displays on your screen.

So, in a nutshell, a GET request is like asking for information from a web server, and the server sends that information back to your computer so you can see it in your web browser. 

# What annotation should be placed on your Spring Boot application class?

In a Spring Boot application, you should place the @SpringBootApplication annotation on your main application class. This annotation combines multiple annotations (@Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan) to configure and bootstrap your application. It designates the primary application class and enables essential Spring Boot features. This central annotation simplifies application setup and allows you to start your Spring Boot application using the SpringApplication.run() method in the main method.


# What method allows for a variable defined in Java (in your Spring Controller) to be dispalyed in HTML with the help of Thymeleaf?

You can display a Java variable in HTML using Thymeleaf by placing the variable in your Spring Controller's model, and then accessing it in the HTML template using ${variableName} syntax. This allows dynamic data from the Java code to be seamlessly integrated into the HTML for rendering in a Spring MVC application.
# Explain the role of a @Controller class in a Spring MVC application.
A @Controller class in a Spring MVC application acts as the request handler, responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests. It maps specific requests to methods using annotations, performs business logic, prepares data (model attributes) for the view, and selects the appropriate view template for rendering the response. It plays a central role in managing the flow of the application, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for organized and maintainable web application development.

# What is a model attribute refered to in Thymeleaf?
In Thymeleaf, a model attribute refers to data passed from a Spring Controller to a template for rendering. It acts as a variable holding dynamic content, and you can access these attributes in the template using the ${attributeName} syntax, enabling dynamic data integration into the HTML structure during rendering.
