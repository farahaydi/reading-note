3- Case Sensitivity
4- Spaces in Names 
5- Hidden Files and Directories
>With this knowledge, users can confidently work with files and directories while leveraging the power and flexibility of the Linux operating system.

# Manual Pages:

# Cheat Sheet
It includes essential commands for basic navigation (pwd, ls, cd), file handling (file, spaces in names, hidden files, permissions), process management (CTRL+C, kill, ps, CTRL+Z, jobs, fg), Manual Pages (man) and Vi/Vim editors. Filters (head, tail, sort, wc, grep), useful commands (du, df, basename, find, shutdown), file manipulation (mkdir, rmdir, touch, cp, mv, rm), wildcards (*, ?, []), and piping/redirection (>, >>, 2>, <, |) are also covered. This cheat sheet is a valuable resource for efficient and productive command line usage.
