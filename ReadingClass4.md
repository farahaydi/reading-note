**Explain the difference between an object and a class.**

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.

An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. This lesson explains how state and behavior are represented within an object, introduces the concept of data encapsulation, and explains the benefits of designing your software in this manner.

**Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.**
The constructor is a critical part of a class in object-oriented programming, responsible for initializing objects during creation. It ensures a consistent starting state for objects, maintains data integrity, and supports encapsulation. It can handle complex initialization tasks, provide default values, and enable proper inheritance. Multiple constructors offer flexibility for different use cases, making the object creation process controlled and predictable. Overall, the constructor's significance is in ensuring object integrity, setup, and usability within an object-oriented system.

**Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).**


public class Student { // Fields and methods will be defined here }




**What is the value of the binary number 1101?**

So, the value of the binary number 1101 is 13 in decimal notation.

**Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.**

52 is 110100.
