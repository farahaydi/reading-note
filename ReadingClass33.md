# Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.
Asynchronous actions refer to tasks or operations in a program that do not happen immediately or sequentially in the order they are written in the code. Instead, they occur in the background while the program continues with other tasks. This allows the program to perform multiple operations simultaneously, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness.

In practical terms, when an asynchronous action is initiated, the program doesn't wait for it to complete before moving on to the next task. It may continue executing other code and return to the asynchronous action once it has finished. This is particularly useful for tasks that may take some time to complete, such as fetching data from a remote server, reading from a file, or performing complex calculations. Asynchronous programming helps prevent the program from becoming unresponsive while waiting for long-running tasks to finish.
