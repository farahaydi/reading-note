## What makes an API RESTful?
A RESTful API is a way for computer programs to talk to each other over the internet. It follows a set of rules to make sure this communication is clear and efficient. These rules include providing all needed information in each message, keeping things separate, and using consistent ways to talk. This helps create organized and effective interactions between programs and servers.

## What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?
Benefits of GraphQL:

Precise Data Retrieval: Clients can request exactly the data they need, reducing unnecessary information.

Fewer Requests: Clients can get multiple pieces of data in one request, which can be faster and more efficient.

Flexibility: Clients can change their queries without requiring server changes, making it adaptable.

Downsides of GraphQL:

Complexity: Setting up a GraphQL server can be more complex than a traditional REST API.

Potential for Over-fetching: Inexperienced developers may request more data than needed.

Security Considerations: Proper security measures are crucial to prevent misuse or overloading of the server.

Learning Curve: Developers may need time to learn how to use GraphQL effectively.

Caching Challenges: Implementing caching can be more complex in GraphQL compared to REST.

## Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.
Imagine you have a magic button that runs your website, but you don't need to worry about the machine it's running on. You just press the button, and it works! That's like "serverless." You don't deal with the servers; you just focus on your website. It's like magic hosting!
