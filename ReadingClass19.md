# Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?
In purely functional programming, data structures are immutable, meaning they cannot be directly modified. Instead, any operation that would change a data structure creates a new copy with the desired changes. This approach ensures referential transparency, making it easier to reason about code behavior, debug, and handle concurrency. While you can't change the state of a data structure directly, you can create new versions reflecting the desired changes, maintaining the integrity of the functional paradigm.

# Define purely functional programming.

Purely functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. In this paradigm, programs are constructed using only functions, and these functions are designed to not have side effects or mutable state. This means that once a data structure is created, it cannot be modified; instead, operations create new data structures. Additionally, functions in purely functional programming depend solely on their input arguments and do not have visibility of any global or local state. This paradigm emphasizes immutability, referential transparency, and the avoidance of side effects, enabling easier reasoning about program behavior and facilitating parallel and concurrent execution.

# How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

The text discusses the fundamental differences between traditional imperative programming and purely functional programming. It highlights that imperative programming involves sequences of steps with mutable variables and state changes, while purely functional programming strictly adheres to the evaluation of mathematical functions without side effects or mutable state. In purely functional programming, data structures cannot be modified; instead, new ones are created to reflect changes. Functions in this paradigm rely solely on input arguments and do not have visibility of global or local state. This approach promotes immutability, referential transparency, and ease of reasoning about program behavior. Transitioning to purely functional programming requires a shift towards function composition and transformation, emphasizing immutability and mathematical function evaluation. This paradigm may be better suited for parallel and concurrent execution.
