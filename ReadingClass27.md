# What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
- A technology similar to Shared Preferences in Android is localStorage in web development. localStorage allows you to store key-value pairs in the client's browser, providing a way to persistently store data even after the browser is closed.
- SharedPreferences in Android can be thought of as similar to an object but it's actually an interface that allows you to interact with a file containing key-value pairs

# Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
n Android can be compared to a stack of books on a shelf. Each book represents an activity in an app, and the order in which the books are arranged on the shelf mirrors the order in which activities were opened.

Similarly, the concept of tasks and the back stack in Android is similar to a normal data structure stack.
