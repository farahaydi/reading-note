# Measuring Emotional Intelligence
> My results were not exactly as I expected. I used to think that I had complete control and mastery over myself, but some of the questions in the test made me think more, especially regarding how I interact with others and how I handle their emotions or share emotions with them. Perhaps I need to make things simpler on my part so that I can improve my social relationships and benefit from the experiences and abilities of others.


# Assessing Bias
"This is the first time I read about the topic of bias, and it's somewhat intriguing. I think I would like to retake the test after a period of working on understanding others to see if my answers to this test would change. I don't believe I am biased towards any specific group or thing, but my lack of understanding of others and awareness of their feelings could lead to some personal bias. Therefore, I will work hard to try to distance myself from bias towards anything negative."
