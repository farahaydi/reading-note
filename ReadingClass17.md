# In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application.
In non-technical terms, using OAuth in your application allows users to log in or sign up using their existing accounts from popular services like Google, GitHub, or other platforms. This means they don't have to create a new username and password just for your app.

Imagine if every time you wanted to use a new app or website, you had to create a brand new account with a unique username and password. It would be a lot to remember, right? OAuth makes it easier by letting you use your existing accounts from trusted services. It's like using your Google or Facebook account to log in to different apps or games without having to remember a bunch of different usernames and passwords. It's convenient and saves time!


# Which authentication providers are covered in the tutorial?

The tutorial covers two authentication providers: GitHub and Google. It shows how to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication using these two popular platforms. This means users can log in to the application using their GitHub or Google accounts, providing a convenient and familiar way to access the app.
