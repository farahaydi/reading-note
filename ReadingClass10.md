# Implementation: Stacks and Queues
>> The Cafeteria Stack - LIFO (Last-In-First-Out):
Imagine you're at a cafeteria. The cafeteria trays are stacked on top of each other. When you pick up a tray, you take the one that's on the top of the stack. As new trays arrive, they are added to the top of the stack. When it's time to clean up, you start removing trays from the top of the stack. This is how a stack works in computer science.

> **What is a Stack?** A stack is a linear data structure where elements are stored one on top of another. The last element added is the first one to be removed - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.

> **Why Use a Stack?** Stacks are great for tasks like managing function calls, keeping track of the previous state in an application, and parsing expressions.

> **How Does a Stack Work?** You can perform two main operations: push (adding an item to the top) and pop (removing the top item). The top item is always the most recently added.
> **Common terminology for a stack is**
1. Push: The operation of adding an element onto the top of the stack.
2. Pop: The operation of removing the top element from the stack.
3. Top: The top element of the stack, the most recently pushed element.
4. Empty: A stack is considered empty when it contains no elements.
5. Full: A stack is considered full when it has reached its maximum capacity (if it has a fixed size).
6. Peek: Viewing the top element without removing it from the stack.
7. Size: The number of elements currently in the stack.
8. Overflow: When attempting to push an element onto a full stack.
9. Underflow: When attempting to pop an element from an empty stack.


>> The Ticket Queue - FIFO (First-In-First-Out):
Now, let's switch to a ticket booth scenario. Imagine people lining up to buy tickets. The person who arrives first gets the first ticket, and as new people join the line, they get tickets in the order they arrived. The person at the front of the line gets served first. This is how a queue works in computer science.

> **What is a Queue?** A queue is a linear data structure where elements are added at the back and removed from the front. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

> **Why Use a Queue?** Queues are useful for tasks like managing tasks in a printer queue, implementing breadth-first search algorithms, and handling asynchronous tasks.

> **How Does a Queue Work?** You perform two primary operations: enqueue (adding an item to the back) and dequeue (removing the front item). The front item is the one that has been in the queue the longest.

> **Common terminology for a queue is**
1. Enqueue: The operation of adding an element to the back (end) of the queue.
2. Dequeue: The operation of removing the front (first) element from the queue.
3. Front: The front element of the queue, the one that will be dequeued next.
4. Back (Rear): The back element of the queue, where new elements are enqueued.
5. Empty: A queue is considered empty when it contains no elements.
6. Full: A queue is considered full when it has reached its maximum capacity (if it has a fixed size).
7. Peek (Front Peek): Viewing the front element without removing it from the queue.
8. Size: The number of elements currently in the queue.
9. Overflow: When attempting to enqueue an element onto a full queue.
10. Underflow: When attempting to dequeue an element from an empty queue.

"Great idea to learn stacks and queues! I need to practice more and more to get the full idea about this 2 importent data Structure".
